## Atomic Structure and the Periodic Table
### Atoms:
#### The Nucleus
1. It's the middle of an **atom**.
2. It contains **protons** and **neutrons**.
3. The nucleus has overall *postive charge* because protons are positively charged and the neutrons have no charge.
4. Almost all of the **mass** of the atom is concentrated in the **nucleus**.
5. But size-wise, the nucleus is tiny compared to the rest of the atom.

#### Electrons
1. They move around the **nucleus**.
2. They have a *negative charge* (electrons and protons have equal opposite charges).
3. They are tiny compared to the **nucleus**, but as they move around they cover a lot of space.
4. The size of their **orbits** determines how big the atom is.
5. They occupy shells (energy levels) around the **nucleus**.

#### Number of Protons Equals Number of Electrons
1. Neutral atoms have no charge.
2. The charge on the electrons is the same as the charge on the protons, but opposite.
3. This means the number of protons always equals the number of electrons in an atom.
4. The number of neutrons isn't fixed but is usually the same as the number of protons.

#### Know your particles ...
1. Protons are **heavy** and *positively charged*.
2. Neutrons are **heavy** and *neutral* (no charge).
3. Electrons are **tiny** and *negatively charged*.

  *Protons*:
  * Relative mass - 1
  * Relative charge - +1

  *Neutrons*:
  * Relative mass - 1
  * Relative charge - 0

  *Electrons*:
  * Relative mass - 1/2000
  * Relative charge - -1

## Electron Shells
#### The Electron shell rules ...
1. Electrons **always** occupy shells (or Energy levels).
2. The *lowest* energy levels are **always** filled first - the ones closest to the **nucleus**.
3. Only *a certain number* of electrons are allowed in each shell:
  * 1ST SHELL: 2
  * 2ND SHELL: 8
  * 3RD SHELL: 8
4. Atoms are much 'happier' when they have *full electron shells*.
5. In most atoms, the *outer shell is not full* and this makes them want to *react*.

#### Electronic configurations

**Here's an example:**
1. Nitrogen has **seven** protons ... so it must have **seven** electrons.
2. *Using the electron rules above ...* The **first** shell can only take 2 electrons and the **second** can take a maximum of eight electrons.
3. so the electronic configuration must be **2.5**
  * 2 electrons on the first shell, and five on the second.

## Elements

**Elements consist of ONE TYPE of ATOM only.**

Quite a lot of everyday substances are **elements**:
* Copper
* Aluminium
* Iron
* Oxygen
* Nitrogen

*Just to name a few ...*

**Each Element has a DIFFERENT number of PROTONS.**

It's the number of protons in an atom that decides what element it is.
For example, any atom of the element *helium* will have *2 protons* - and any atom with *2 protons* will be a *helium* atom.

#### Atomic and Mass Numbers
**Each element has an ATOMIC NUMBER and a MASS NUMBER.**
1. The *atomic number* says how many *protons* there are in an atom.
2. The *atomic number* is unique to that element, because no two elements have the same number of protons. E.g only Oxygen has an atomic number of 8.
3. The *atomic number* also tells you have many electrons there are, because an atom has the same number of electrons as protons.
4. The *mass number* is the total number of protons and neutrons in an atom. So if you need to find the number of neutrons in an atom, just subtract the atomic number from the mass number.
5. The mass number is usually *rough double* the *atomic number*, because there's about the same number of neutrons as protons in any nucleus.

*On a Periodic Table, The Mass number is above the Element symbol, and the Atomic number is below.*

## Isotopes & Relative Atomic Mass
*Some elements have more than one isotope*.
#### Isotopes are the same for an extra NEUTRON or two.
Favourite trick exam question: "What is meant by the term isotope?".
The trick is that it is impossible to explain what one isotope is.

To outsmart them always start your answer with "Isotopes are ..."

**Here's the definition:**

>**Isotopes** are: different atomic forms of the same element, which have the SAME number of PROTONS but DIFFERENT numbers of NEUTRONS.

1. The upshot is: Isotopes must have the same number of protons but a *different* mass number.
2. If they had a different number of protons, they'd be different elements altogether.
3. A very popular pair of isotopes are carbon-12 and carbon-14

#### Relative Atomic Mass takes ISOTOPES into account
1. Relative atomic mass (A<sub>r</sub>) uses the average mass of the isotopes of an element. It has to allow for the relative mass of each isotope and its relative abundance.
2. Relative abundance just means how much there is of each isotope compared to the total amount of the element in the world. This can be a *ratio*, a *fraction* or a *percentage*.

**EXAMPLE:** Work out the relative atomic mass of chlorine.

Element | Relative mass of isotope | Relative abundance
--- | --- | ---
Chlorine: | 35 | 3
 | 37 | 1

The table shows that there are two isotopes of chlorine. One with a relative mass of 35 (<sup>35</sup>Cl) and the other with 37 (<sup>37</sup>Cl).

The relative abundances show that there are 3 of <sup>35</sup>Cl to every 1 of <sup>37</sup>Cl.

> * First, multiply the mass of each isotope by its relative abundance.
> * Add those together
> * Then Divide by the sum of the relative abundances.


**A<sub>r</sub> = (35 x 3) + (37 x 1) / 3 + 1 = 35.5**

* Relative atomic masses don't usually come out as whole numbers or easy decimals, but they're often rounded to the **nearest 0.5** in periodic tables.

## A brief history of the Periodic Table
#### They put ELEMENTS in order of their ATOMIC MASS
1. In the 1800s scientists had no idea about the structure of atoms, but they could measure the relative atomic mass of each element.
2. When all the elements were put in order of their relative atomic mass, scientists began to notice periodic patterns in the properties of the elements.

#### Mendeleev

**Mendeleev** arranged 50 or so known elements into groups according to their properties and the properties of their compounds to make table elements. He placed elements with similar chemical properties in the same vertical groups. He found he had to leave gaps to make his table work though.

* These gaps helped Mendeleev to predict new elements because he knew the properties.

## The Periodic Table

The periodic table shows elements in order of increasing atomic number along each row.

Metals and Non-metals are on opposite sides of the table.

The table is arranged in periods and groups

##### Periods
  * Rows across table called periods
  * Increasing in atomic number
  * Properties of the elements change as you go along the Rows

##### Groups
  * Columns of the table called groups
  * Elements in the same group has similar properties because they have the same number of electrons in their outer cell
  * Group number is equal to the number of electrons in the outer shell
  * Properties of elements often gradually change as you go down a group
